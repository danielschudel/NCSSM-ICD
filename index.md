# Rides to and from NCSSM and Immaculate Conception Catholic Church

The community of Durham's [Immaculate Conception Catholic Church](http://icdurham.org/) has long enjoyed the 
presence of NCSSM students at our weekend Masses. Parishioners traditionally provide rides for students
between NCSSM and Immaculate Conception for the Sunday 9:30 AM Mass.

Due to COVID-19, the 2020-2021 academic year was quite different. I primarily worked to lead group bike rides
to outdoor Masses at Immaculate Conception. This was due to NCSSM restrictions not allowing ride-share, and, due to
general lack of availability of a COVID-19 vaccine.

## Masses for 2021/2022

It is good news that NCSSM will be moving to full capacity and a full calendar for the 2021/2022 academic year. Welcome to Durham
everyone! The parent meeting on Aug-2 made it clear, however, that the NCSSM administration is approaching this year very cautiously
with respect to COVID. They are holding off on running the Durham bus loops, discouraging use of ride-share (Uber/Lyft), and discouraging public transportation.

With that in mind, we will not begin the year offering personal car/van rides to Mass at Immaculate Conception.

Instead, I will continue to offer to lead bike rides from the NCSSM campus to Immaculate Conception on Sundays when the weather is nice and the parish holds outdoor Mass.
The bike ride is a very easy and pleasant ride through mostly residential areas. Sunday morning streets in Durham always have little car traffic. The one-way trip time is maybe about
15 minutes.

## Preliminary 2021/2022 Mass Schedule:

## Future Consideration

I'll continue to monitor NCSSM policies as well as local COVID infection rates. Once we are in the clear again, I will resume coordinating rides to Mass. As a precaution, all drivers will be vaccinated 
against COVID, and I will ask the same of any student that rides in our personal vehicles.
