# Rides to and from NCSSM and Immaculate Conception Catholic Church

The community of Durham's [Immaculate Conception Catholic Church](http://icdurham.org/) has long enjoyed the 
presence of NCSSM students at our weekend Masses. Parishioners traditionally provide rides for students
between NCSSM and Immaculate Conception for the Sunday 9:30 AM Mass.

Due to COVID-19, the 2020-2021 academic year was quite different. We primarily worked to provide group bike rides
to outdoor Masses at Immaculate Conception. This was due to NCSSM restrictions not allowing ride-share, and, due to
general availability of a COVID-19 vaccine.

## Masses for 2021/2022

I understand that NCSSM will be moving to full capacity and a full calendar for the 2021/2022 academic year. It isn't clear
to me at this moment if the off-campus travel restrictions will remain in place. Once there is clarity on travel, I'll decide
if we can provide car rides or if we need to continue group bike rides.

If we are permitted to provide car rides to students, know that volunteer drivers have completed the required Diocesan training,
as well as having been vaccinated against COVID-19.

## Preliminary 2021/2022 Mass Schedule:
