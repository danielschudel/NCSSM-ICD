# Rides to and from NCSSM and Immaculate Conception Catholic Church

The community of Durham's [Immaculate Conception Catholic Church](http://icdurham.org/) has long enjoyed the 
presence of NCSSM students at our weekend Masses. Parishioners traditionally provide rides for students
between NCSSM and Immaculate Conception for the Sunday 9:30 AM Mass.

## COVID-19 Considerations

* We require that all riders be fully vaccinated. All drivers are fully vaccinated also.
* Will remain masked while in vehicles.
* We are limiting the number of riders.
* You can attend Mass inside the church or outside. I usually attend the outdoor Mass outdoors (weather permitting).
