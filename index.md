# Rides to and from NCSSM and Immaculate Conception Catholic Church

The community of Durham's [Immaculate Conception Catholic Church](http://icdurham.org/) has long enjoyed the 
presence of NCSSM students at our weekend Masses. Parishioners traditionally provide rides for students
between NCSSM and Immaculate Conception for the Sunday 9:30 AM Mass.

Due to COVID-19, this year will need to be different, in that we will not be able to provide rides to Immaculate Conception
via vehicle. NCSSM is restricting students from using ride-share, plus, our regular drivers are not comfortable providing rides
until a vaccine is widely available.

## Outdoor Masses for Fall 2020

Immaculate Conception will be holding outdoor Masses
beginning the weekend of October 4th. This timing will align with you students that are on campus with Cohort-B. We can explore
biking between the NCSSM campus and Immaculate Conception. The distance is about 2.5 miles, which would be about 15 minutes
biking. I am willing to coordinate and be present for these rides.

If you are interested in biking - please let me know by filling out this short info page. Cohort-A students should also
fill out the survey so that we are prepared for 2021.

## Other Resources from Immaculate Conception

For those that will not be able to make it to one of the outdoor Masses - I can provide the following aides for remaining in touch with your faith while on campus:

1. [www.icdurham.org](http://www.icdurham.org/) - The main Parish website has embedded YouTube video players where you can
   watch the 9:30 Sunday Mass live - or replayed at a later more convenient time.
1. [General Mass Schedule](http://www.icdurham.org/mass-and-devotion-schedule-and-archive.html) - This explains what Mass times
   are celebrated with attendees, and which are broadcast only.
1. [Parish YouTube Channel](https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCWHb9hem4de1IsQ_a6v5upg) - Subscribe and set that notification
   bell. You receive notifications on upcoming Masses, and, videos that the Friars post from time to time.
