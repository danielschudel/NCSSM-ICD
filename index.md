# Rides to and from NCSSM and Immaculate Conception Catholic Church

The community of Durham's [Immaculate Conception Catholic Church](http://icdurham.org/) have long enjoyed the 
presence of NCSSM students at our weekend Masses. We will continue to work to provide rides for you between
Immaculate Conception and the NCSSM campus.

* We meet in Bryan lobby prior to Mass for pick-up.
* See the sign-up sheet for the meeting time as it will vary based on what Mass you are attending
* After Mass we all meet back together again in the Church's gathering space, near the main entrance doors, for the return trip to campus.

Please sign-up using the links below so that we know to expect you. Check this page each week for updates to the sign-up forms.
