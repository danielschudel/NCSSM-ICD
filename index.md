# Rides to and from NCSSM and Immaculate Conception Catholic Church

The community of Durham's [Immaculate Conception Catholic Church](http://icdurham.org/) has long enjoyed the 
presence of NCSSM students at our weekend Masses. Parishioners traditionally provide rides for students
between NCSSM and Immaculate Conception for the Sunday 9:30 AM Mass.

Due to COVID-19, this year will need to be different. COVID-19 has curtailed the majority of regular celebrated Mass times.
Our regular Sunday 9:30AM Mass is celebrated without attendees present, but, is broadcasted through YouTube.
Additionally, while at NCSSM,
students will not be permitted to use ride sharing services and are discouraged from riding in vehicles in the greater Triangle
area.

I can provide the following aides for remaining in touch with your faith while on campus:

1. [www.icdurham.org](http://www.icdurham.org/) - The main Parish website has embedded YouTube video players where you can
   watch the 9:30 Sunday Mass live - or replayed at a later more convenient time.
1. [General Mass Schedule](http://www.icdurham.org/mass-and-devotion-schedule-and-archive.html) - This explains what Mass times
   are celebrated with attendees, and which are broadcast only.
1. [Parish YouTube Channel](https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCWHb9hem4de1IsQ_a6v5upg) - Subscribe and set that notification
   bell. You receive notifications on upcoming Masses, and, videos that the Friars post from time to time.

On behalf of Immaculate Conception, *Welcome to Durham*! We keep our hopes high that we can meet each of you this year,

Daniel Schudel
